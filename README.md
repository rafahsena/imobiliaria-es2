### Philosophy

- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- 🚀 Production-ready
### Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
yarn
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Setting the database

First things first, create your .env file by running the following command:

```shell
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Then you need to copy the environment values from the _docker-compose.yml_ file to fill in the default values of the DATABASE_URL variable on .env file:

```DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname"```

To get your host ip, simply inspect all your docker containers and copy the one corresponding to your db

```shell
$ docker inspect --format='{{.Name}} {{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' $(docker ps -q)
```

By completing the filling process on the .env file, run the following command to run the migrations over your database:

```shell
$ npx prisma migrate dev
```

To visualize the database using prisma studio:
```shell 
$ npx prisma studio 
```

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate. Please change the following file:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/Main.tsx`: default theme

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
yarn build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.
